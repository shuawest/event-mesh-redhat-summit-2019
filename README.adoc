What is this?
=============

This is the companion demo of the talk on "Building a Global Distributed Service Mesh" delivered at Red Hat Summit 2019.


How to set up the demo?
=======================

1. Create an OpenShift cluster.

2. Use the provisioning script to create projects and deploy AMQ Broker and AMQ interconnect for all three regions:

    ./provision-rhpds-ocp3.11.sh <UUID> <admin_user> <admin_password>

This will deploy the routers, the brokers and the applications
